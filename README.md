# 5G-Sales-Insights

This project was quite old and was a part of Code Basics Resume Challenge 3.


# Objective:
AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India, launched its 5G services in May 2022. However, the company observed a significant decline in both active users and revenue growth after the rollout. The business director tasked the analytics team with conducting a comparative analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) before and after the 5G launch. The primary goal of the analysis is to provide actionable insights to enhance user retention, optimize internet plans, and drive future business strategies.

# Approach:
The AtliQo data team provided clean, structured data ready for analysis. The key steps involved in this project were:

* Data Modeling:

Built a robust data model in Power BI, ensuring the relationships between key data tables (users, revenue, and service plans) were well-defined for accurate reporting.
* KPI Development:

Developed critical KPIs such as active user count, revenue growth, churn rates, and customer engagement metrics to measure the performance pre- and post-5G launch.
* Metrics and Measures:

Created essential measures, including Month-over-Month (MoM) revenue trends, variance analysis for active users, and comparative metrics for customer retention by region and plan type.
* Visualizations:

Designed interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize key trends. These dashboards showcase revenue performance, user churn, and plan preference before and after the 5G rollout, along with detailed variance analyses for actionable insights.
* Insights & Recommendations:

The analysis revealed that while overall revenue initially dipped post-launch, certain regions like Delhi and Chennai exhibited promising growth in active users.
Customers expressed a preference for plans offering daily data usage over bundle packs.
Strategies like targeted customer retention campaigns, plan adjustments, and enhanced customer service were recommended to improve post-launch engagement and reduce churn.
* Key Power BI Features Used:
** Data Modeling: Built relationships between tables for streamlined analysis.
* DAX Measures: Created custom calculations for MoM variance, total active users, revenue growth, and churn rate.
* Interactive Visuals: Line charts, bar charts, and tables with dynamic filters to explore various dimensions such as time, region, and plan type.
* KPI Dashboards: Visual representation of revenue, user retention, and other vital metrics.
Technologies:
* Power BI: Data modeling, DAX for custom measures, interactive visuals, and dashboard creation.
